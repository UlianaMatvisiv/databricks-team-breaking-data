# Missing values challenge - Team Breaking data

## Setup
The code was created on the Databricks platform in a GitHub repo, so some of the functions may not run correctly simply using Python. 

### How to run the code, file guide
1. Run "setup" to create schemas 
2. Run load_athens_airbnb_data to get the data our team worked with during the assignment
3. Run Missing_data_visualisation and/or review_analysis. The first file contains a universal module that will analyse missing values in the data frame, while the other is a short research on review values in the Athens Airbnb data
